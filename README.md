# IST-4070-2025
A class on Object Oriented Programming instructed by Dr.Eunice Mwangi. 
# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Java  

This repository contains my work for the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** class.  
The goal of this repo is to practice and demonstrate key OOP principles using the **Java programming language**.

## 📚 Course Focus  
Throughout this course, we will explore:  
- **Classes and Objects** – designing real-world entities in code  
- **Encapsulation** – protecting data using access modifiers (private, public, protected)  
- **Inheritance** – reusing code and extending functionality  
- **Polymorphism** – method overriding and overloading for flexible design  
- **Abstraction** – hiding implementation details with abstract classes and interfaces  
- **File Handling** – reading/writing data to files in Java  
- **Exception Handling** – managing errors gracefully  
- **Java Collections** – working with arrays, lists, maps, and sets
